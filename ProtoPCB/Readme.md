Simple PCB for an ad-hoc build of NABU expansion devices. All NABU signals are labeled for ease of connection.

Sources are in KiCad 6.0, you can use those to create gerbers or simply order from [PCBWay]9https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/NABU_PC_Prototyping_PCB_ee055662.html)

And here is an example of using the proto PCB to build a CF card adapter for NABU
